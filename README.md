# Finance Tracker (Angular + Ionic)

This project is a basic Finance Tracker application built with Angular and Ionic. It was developed as a learning exercise to explore cross-platform application development using the Ionic framework. The application focuses on a simplified input and visualization workflow, without the use of a backend or database.

## Project Overview

The app allows users to input spending amounts in three fixed categories: **Groceries**, **Rent**, and **Other**. Once entered, the data is displayed in a chart for visual representation of the distribution. The chart can be saved as an image or as a settings file to reuse later. All data is stored in-memory for the duration of the session.

This project is designed to demonstrate practical use of Angular components, Ionic layout systems, form handling, and simple data visualization.

## Features
